# hello-world
Following the directions for my first repository here

New coder here working to put together something i can use to build my skills as a developer.  
C# seems to be a prominent skill set, so i am starting there, but i don't know what order to branch out when it comes to things like JSON, APIs, Angular, front or back end development etc.
